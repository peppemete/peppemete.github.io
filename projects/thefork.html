                        <p>The Fork is the main online restaurant booking platform. 
                            We worked on this project during the UX design course.
                            The goal of this project was to redesign the current app, adding new features chosen after careful research.</p>

                        <p>In This Project We Used The Circle As A Reference Shape, This Can Be Seen Already From The Splashscreen. Quick Buttons Have Been Inserted In The Home, For Quick Searches. To Overcome The Problem, That Without The Location Permissions, The App Cannot Load The Home, We Have Thought Of Inserting Generic Sections To Start Searching, Such As Cities, Cousine And Offers.</p>

                        <p>From Our Research, It Has Been Shown That Some People, Especially When Using The App For The First Time, Are Reluctant To Register. So We Decided To Introduce This New Feature, Through Which Users Can Book A Table, By Entering Only Name, Surname, Email And Telephone Number. In Developing This New Feature, We Also Focused On Improving The Booking Flow, Which Was Originally Divided Over Several Pages, While Now, Using Carousels, It Has Been Reduced To Only One.</p>

                        <p>Our Research Has Also Shown That A Classic Problem Is That Of Discounts, Because In Most Cases The User Must Request It At The Cashier To Take Advantage Of The Discount And This Can Cause Negative Figures In Front Of The Guests. To Solve This Problem, We Hypothesized To Allow The Payment Of Bill Through The App.</p>
